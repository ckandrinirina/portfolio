# Story 09-05: Lighthouse Performance & SEO Audit

> **Epic:** Quality, Accessibility & Performance
> **Size:** M
> **Status:** TODO

## Description

Run Lighthouse against the production build and iterate on any optimizations
needed to reach performance ≥ 95 and accessibility ≥ 95. Verify that all SEO
checks pass (title, meta description, Open Graph and Twitter Card tags, correct
`lang` attribute), and confirm the first-load experience is under 1.5 s on
broadband. Document the final scores — a screenshot or exported JSON report is
committed to the repository as evidence of the Definition of Done.

This story runs after accessibility fixes (09-01) and responsiveness fixes
(09-02) are merged, so scores measured here reflect the final site state. It
also depends on SEO meta tags being in place (07-03) and the GitHub Pages deploy
being live (08-01) so the audit can optionally be run against the real CDN URL
as a final confirmation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Lighthouse performance score is ≥ 95 when run on the production build via
  `npm run preview` (localhost:4173), desktop preset.
- [ ] Lighthouse accessibility score is ≥ 95 when run on the production build,
  desktop preset, in both light and dark modes.
- [ ] Lighthouse SEO audit passes all checks: document has a `<title>`, has a
  meta description, links have descriptive text, `<html>` has a valid `lang`
  attribute, page is not blocked from indexing.
- [ ] Open Graph tags (`og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `og:url`,
  `og:type`) and Twitter Card tags (`twitter:card`, `twitter:title`,
  `twitter:description`, `twitter:image`) are verified present in the built
  `index.html`.
- [ ] First Contentful Paint (FCP) is ≤ 1.5 s and Largest Contentful Paint
  (LCP) is ≤ 2.5 s in the Lighthouse run.
- [ ] Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is ≤ 0.1 (no significant layout instability
  on load).
- [ ] Total Blocking Time (TBT) is ≤ 200 ms.
- [ ] The og-image asset (if used) is a compressed JPEG or WebP file ≤ 200 KB.
- [ ] No render-blocking resources are reported by Lighthouse that are under
  the project's control.
- [ ] The final Lighthouse report (screenshot of the scores panel or the
  exported JSON) is committed to `docs/audits/lighthouse-<date>.json` (or a
  `.png` equivalent) as permanent evidence.
- [ ] Optionally: Lighthouse is also run against the live GitHub Pages URL and
  passes the same thresholds (noted in a comment if scores differ from local).

## Technical Notes

- Always run Lighthouse on the production build, not the dev server. The dev
  server includes unminified assets, HMR scripts, and source maps that inflate
  bundle size and degrade performance scores.
  ```bash
  npm run build && npm run preview
  # Then open Chrome, navigate to http://localhost:4173
  # DevTools → Lighthouse → Desktop → Generate report
  ```
- Lighthouse must be run in an Incognito window (or with extensions disabled)
  to avoid extension interference. The axe-DevTools extension, for example, adds
  noticeable overhead.
- Common performance bottlenecks on a Vite/React static site:
  - **og-image**: a large PNG og-image (e.g., 1200 × 630 px) can be 500 KB+.
    Convert to JPEG or WebP and compress to ≤ 200 KB.
  - **Profile photo** (if present): serve as WebP, sized to display dimensions
    (e.g., 400 × 400 px max), with `width`/`height` attributes to prevent CLS.
  - **Unused CSS**: Tailwind v4 with the Vite plugin tree-shakes unused classes;
    verify the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin is correctly configured.
  - **Font loading**: if Google Fonts or any external font is added, use
    `display=swap` and preconnect hints to prevent render blocking.
  - **Third-party scripts**: none expected in this project — confirm no analytics
    or chat widget was accidentally added.
- SEO verification checklist:
  - `<title>` — should be "Erick Andrinirina — Fullstack JavaScript Engineer"
    or equivalent.
  - `<meta name="description">` — concise, ≤ 160 chars.
  - `<meta property="og:image">` — absolute URL (requires correct
    `VITE_SITE_URL` or equivalent env var used when generating meta tags).
  - `<html lang="fr">` on first load (confirmed by 09-01).
- If the performance score is between 90 and 95, investigate the specific
  opportunities and diagnostics Lighthouse reports. The most impactful levers
  on a static site are image optimization and eliminating unused JS (verify
  code-splitting is working via `vite build --report` or rollup-plugin-visualizer).
- Export the Lighthouse report: in Chrome DevTools Lighthouse tab, click the
  download arrow (↓) next to the score to save the full JSON. Commit that JSON
  to the repo for traceability.

## Files to Create/Modify

| Action | File Path | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| MODIFY | `public/og-image.jpg` (or `.webp`) | Compress og-image to ≤ 200 KB; convert from PNG if needed |
| MODIFY | `vite.config.ts` | Verify build config: no source maps in production, asset inlining thresholds |
| CREATE | `docs/audits/lighthouse-YYYY-MM-DD.json` | Committed Lighthouse report as Definition-of-Done evidence |
| MODIFY | `src/sections/Hero.tsx` | Add `width`/`height` to profile photo `<img>` to prevent CLS (if applicable) |
