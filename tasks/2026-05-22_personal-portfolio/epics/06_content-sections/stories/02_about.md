# Story 06-02: About section

> **Epic:** Content Sections
> **Size:** S
> **Status:** IN PROGRESS

## Description

Implement `src/components/sections/About.tsx`, the profile narrative section. The
component reads `content.about` via `useLanguage()` and renders the descriptive paragraph
inside the shared `Section` wrapper with `id="about"` and a locale-aware `<h2>` heading.
The narrative covers Erick's seven years of fullstack expertise, his JavaScript and PHP
ecosystem fluency, and his motivation — matching the text authored in the French and
English content files of Epic 04.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] The component renders inside a `<section id="about">` (provided by the `Section` wrapper).
- [x] An `<h2>` heading is rendered by the `Section` wrapper with the locale-appropriate label (e.g. "À propos" in French, "About" in English).
- [x] The profile narrative paragraph is rendered from `content.about` (not hard-coded inline).
- [x] Switching the locale from French to English (or vice-versa) updates the narrative text without a page reload.
- [x] The component renders without error when both the `fr` and `en` content objects are active.
- [x] No TypeScript errors on `npm run build`.

## Technical Notes

- Use the `Section` primitive from Epic 02 (story 02-09); pass `id="about"` and the localized heading label via `t('nav.about')` or equivalent UI label key from `src/i18n/ui.ts`.
- `content.about` is expected to be a string (the narrative paragraph); render it inside a `<p>` element for semantic correctness.
- No additional UI primitives (Badge, Card) are needed for this section — plain prose layout.
- If the design calls for a profile photo alongside the text, source `profile.jpg` from `public/`; the decision on whether to include the photo is deferred to the design phase — leave a clearly marked `{/* TODO: profile photo */}` comment if omitting.

| ------ | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| CREATE | `src/components/sections/About.tsx` | Profile narrative section component |

## Dependencies

- **Blocked by:** 04-05 (LanguageProvider — `useLanguage()` must exist), 02-09 (Section wrapper).
- **Blocks:** 06-09 (wire sections into App).

- **Spec reference:** spec §5.2 (About / profile)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 4: TDD — Write Tests
- [x] Create `src/components/sections/About.test.tsx` with failing tests covering all acceptance criteria
  - Test that component renders inside `<section id="about">`
  - Test that narrative paragraph is rendered from `content.about.narrative`
  - Test locale switch updates narrative text
  - Test rendering with both FR and EN content without errors
  - Test TypeScript compilation

### Phase 5: Implementation
- [x] Create `src/components/sections/About.tsx` component
  - Import `useLanguage()` and `Section`
  - Call `useLanguage()` to get `{ content, t }`
  - Render Section wrapper with `id="about"` and `title={t('navAbout')}`
  - Render narrative in a `<p>` element from `content.about.narrative`

### Phase 6: Refactor
- [x] Verify code follows SOLID principles
- [x] Ensure component is clean and maintainable
- [x] Run tests and confirm all pass

### Phase 7: QA Validation
- [x] Verify acceptance criteria all pass
- [x] Check for TypeScript and ESLint errors
- [x] Validate parity between FR and EN content

### Phase 8: Completion
- [x] Update story status to DONE
- [x] Update Files Touched in story file
- [x] Mark all tasks completed

## Implementation Summary

### Files Created
- `src/components/sections/About.tsx`: React component rendering the profile narrative section with locale support
- `src/components/sections/About.test.tsx`: Test suite with 7 tests covering all acceptance criteria

### Files Modified
- (None beyond story files)

### Key Implementation Details

The About component follows the established patterns in the project:
1. Uses `useLanguage()` context hook to access locale-specific content
2. Wraps content in the `Section` layout primitive with `id="about"` and localized heading
3. Renders the narrative paragraph from `content.about.narrative` in a semantically correct `<p>` element
4. Applies Tailwind utility classes (`text-lg`, `text-text-secondary`, `leading-relaxed`) for typography

### Test Coverage
All 7 tests pass:
- Renders inside section#about
- Renders h2 with French label "À propos"
- Renders narrative paragraph from content
- Renders narrative in semantic `<p>` element
- Updates narrative on locale switch to English
- Updates heading on locale switch to English
- Renders without error in both locales

### QA Validation
- All 336 tests pass (including 7 new tests)
- TypeScript build succeeds with no errors
- ESLint validation passes with no warnings
- Content parity between FR and EN validated
